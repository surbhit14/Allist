Allist is a platform for you to see transactions of all chains at one place 
Are you tired of being unable to see all your multichain transactions or missing out on some ERC20 tokens which you had no idea you received cause you forgot to add the token in your wallet.
Don't worry because, Allist has got you covered 
Users can easily register using their email and providing their address and then see all their transactions for multiple chains

Allist uses sponsor Covalent api (Get transactions for address) to get/fetch all the transactions for all particular chains linked with the user registered  address.
